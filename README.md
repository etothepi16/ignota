# ignota

ignota is a language creation engine named after what is possibly the [first conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Ignota) in history. Its features are/will be inspired by [Vulgar](http://vulgarlang.com/). Obviously I will not copy anything that they have implemented, but I feel it necessary to credit their amazing work for inspiring me to make my own version of this.

## Sources

The logic behind ignota is based on many sources. Some are general rules-of-thumb I picked up during my linguistics degree, others are based on research I have done since then. Logic for phoneme generation is based on the information contained in [UPSID](http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid_info.html). The word list is modeled after Mark Davie's word frequency [list](https://www.wordfrequency.info/free.asp?s=y) for English. Grammars are generated according to statistics from [WALS](https://wals.info/).
